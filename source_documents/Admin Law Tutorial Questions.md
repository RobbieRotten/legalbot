## Week 2: Admin Law

1 What is administrative law?
(a) Reflecting on core administrative law values, how can we define administrative law as an area of legal practice?
- The powers of the executive branch enacted by delegates in regulating legislation derived from heads of power
- Ensures executive action is within the bounds of the law
  - Rule of law
    - Can make laws but subject to those laws
    - Judicial Review
  - Executive agency
    - Continuation of Judicial Review
      - Attaches morality and policy concerns to policies that survive
(b) Think of some examples in everyday life where administrative law has an impact.
- Service NSW
- Fines/Penalties
- Healthcare
- Shopping
(c) Why is statutory interpretation so crucial to the practice of administrative law?
- Regulation is the primary method of interaction with citizens and reflects the most impact on daily life. 
- Executive boundary evaluation
  - Questions to determine
    - What was the source of power
    - Did they exceed the source
    - How do you challenge it, pursue
2  The foundations of federal administrative law
The 1971 Kerr Committee Report gave rise to a number of the key features of administrative law and oversight at the Commonwealth level in Australia. What were some of the key reforms introduced following the report? (see your textbook for details - Section 1.4.1 in the 6th edition and 1.2.4E in the 7th edition)
- Major Recommendations & Reforms:
  - Judicial Review Reform
    - Led to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), which codified and simplified judicial review procedures.
  - Creation of a General Merits Review Tribunal
    - Established the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) for independent merits review of government decisions.
  - Introduction of the Ombudsman
    - Recommended a government oversight body (Ombudsman Act 1976 (Cth)) to investigate complaints about administrative decisions.
  - Establishment of the Administrative Review Council (ARC)
    - Oversight body to monitor and improve administrative review mechanisms.
  - Proposed Administrative Procedure Act (Not Implemented)
    - Aimed to standardize tribunal procedures across different areas of law.
3 Tribunal decision-making: an example of an administrative decision
Read this decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal:
Craig and Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Freedom of information) [2023] AATA 2785 (28 August 2023)
(a) What are the facts and issues? What decision is being reviewed and what decision is being sought?
- Facts:
  - The DFAT Cable (dated 16 November 2007) was sent by Dr Justin Lee (Deputy Head of Mission in Jakarta) to DFAT headquarters in Canberra. 
  - It summarised discussions between Australian and Indonesian officials regarding the NSW Coronial Inquest into the 1975 deaths of the Balibo Five journalists in Indonesia.
  - DFAT partially released the document but redacted portions under s 33(a)(iii) and s 33(b) of the FOI Act.
  - The US diplomatic cable (dated 21 November 2007), published by WikiLeaks and reported in Australian media, allegedly contained similar information.
  - Mr Craig argued that:
    - The DFAT Cable should be disclosed because similar information was already public via WikiLeaks.
    - The FOI Act should not be used to conceal crimes or override higher laws. 
    - The Tribunal should examine the document to determine if it contained evidence of misconduct.
    - DFAT relied on the affidavit of Mr Ridwaan Jadwat, asserting that disclosure would harm Australia’s international relations with Indonesia.
- Legal Issues:
  - Is the DFAT Cable an "exempt document" under s 33(a)(iii) of the FOI Act?
  - Would disclosure "reasonably be expected to cause damage to the international relations of the Commonwealth"?
  - Does prior public disclosure (via WikiLeaks) remove the exemption under s 33(a)(iii)?
(b) What distinguishes this tribunal decision from judicial decision-making and judgments, which you have mainly encountered to date? 
- Ratio Decidendi:
  - Confidential diplomatic communications are protected under s 33(a)(iii) of the FOI Act.
  - Even if similar information is leaked by a third party, official disclosure can still harm international relations.
  - The Tribunal lacks discretion to override an exemption once it is satisfied that disclosure "could reasonably be expected" to cause harm.
  - The tribunal is simply remaking the decision from the position of the original decision-maker.
    - The Tribunal President acts as the DFAT Minister in this case 
    - Judicial Review
      - Primarily a procedural evaluation, not evaluating the merits of the decision
  - Tribunal Assessment Standards
    - Correct decision
      - Not discretionary
    - Preferable decision
      - Discretionary
  - Lawyers are discouraged from participating in tribunals
## Week 3: Ombudsman 

### Tutorial questions

In our second tutorial in this subject we discuss accountability mechanisms.
1 Jurisdiction of the Ombudsman
Joseph heads up ‘Sydneysiders for Refugees’, a community interest group which advocates for improved treatment of asylum-seekers entering Australia. Recent news reports have detailed a concerning situation involving an immigration detention centre in Sydney.
The detention centre is managed by Justice Inc. pursuant to a contract with the Commonwealth Department of Immigration. Unidentified sources within the detention centre indicate that security officers are employing violent disciplinary methods, and that detainees are being denied access to basic services such as medical care.
The news articles reported that Justice Inc. are denying any allegations of violence and poor treatment of detainees. The spokesperson for the company also indicated that access to medical services has been managed strictly in accordance with Departmental policy, which requires independent assessment of requests for medical assistance by a Department of Immigration official before a detainee can be transferred to an off-site medical centre.
The articles further detailed a particularly concerning case in which a young child had suffered a broken bone after a fall at the detention centre, and had been held at the centre for 24 hours while waiting on approval to move the child to the local hospital for treatment.
(a) Who can initiate an investigation by the Ombudsman in this situation?
- Ombudsman Act 1976 (Cth)
  - s 7(1)
    - Subject to subsection (2), a complaint under this Act may be made to the Ombudsman orally or in writing.
  - Investigate
    - Complaints from individuals (s 5(1)(a)), OR
    - Initiate an investigation on its own motion (s 5(1)(b)).
  - (c) Discretion not to act
    - i) Conduct of the applicant
      - 12 month delay in raising complaint 
        - frivolous, vexatious, or not made in good faith complainant does not have a sufficient interest
      - s 6(1)
    - (ii) Subject matter of the decision
      - relates to a commercial activity of a Department or prescribed authority
      - s 6(12)
    - (iii) Availability of other mechanisms internal review/ complaints tribunal review, legal proceedings
      - s 6(1A), (3), (4)
    - (iv) General catch-all
      - “An investigation, or further investigation, of the action is not warranted having regard to all the circumstances”
      - s 6(1) (b)(3)
- Joseph can complain under s 5(1)(a) and the ombudsman under s 5(1)(b)
(b) Does the Ombudsman have jurisdiction to investigate the conduct of Justice Inc. and the Department of Immigration?
  - Statutory authority s 5(1)(a)
  - Whom?
    - Prescribed authorities (ie body established by legislation for a public purpose): s 5(1)
      - Department of Immigration → "Prescribed Authority
    - Contracted Service Providers (s 3BA) → The Ombudsman can also investigate private entities providing services to the public under a government contract
      -  Justice Inc. (Private Contractor) → Commonwealth service providers: the contracting Department/authority is taken to have performed the action taken by the contractor
        - A commonwealth contract + goods are services not for that department
        - s 3BA defines commonwealth service provider applies to -> s 3(4B) in defining agency for that department
      - Ombudsman cannot look into the policies but can look into the application of the policies in the immigration assessments (administrative (executive) actions, Glenister v Dillon or s 5(1)(a))
(c) What investigative powers can the Ombudsman exercise in the course of an investigation?
- Investigative powers
  - Obtain information and documents 
    - s 9(1)
    - s 8(2)(A)
  - Require a person to attend and answer questions
    - s 9(2)
  - Examine witnesses under oath 
    - s 13
  - Enter premises and inspect documents
    - s 14
(d) What outcomes might the Ombudsman’s investigation produce?
  - Ombudsman Act 1976 (Cth) s 15(1)
    - Contrary to law
    - Unreasonable, unjust, oppressive, improperly discriminatory
    - Applied a law or practice that is unreasonable, unjust, oppressive, improperly discriminatory
    - Based on mistake of law or fact
    - ‘Was otherwise, in all the circumstances, wrong’
    - Exercise of discretionary power:
      - based on an improper purpose or irrelevant grounds

2 Royal Commissions and Indigenous Justice
Read Elena Marchetti, ‘The Deep Colonizing Practices of the Australian Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody’ (2006) 33 Journal of Law and Society 451 
Download The Deep Colonizing Practices of the Australian Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody’ (2006) 33 Journal of Law and Society 451
, and answer each of the following:
(a) Why was a Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC) established and what were its terms of reference? What recommendations were made?
- The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC) was established in 1987 to investigate the deaths of 99 Indigenous people in custody between 1980–1989.
- However, despite extensive findings and 339 recommendations, Indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody remain disproportionately high, and government responses have been inadequate.
- Future inquiries should centre Indigenous knowledge, voices, and leadership rather than filtering them through Western legal structures.
- Legal processes must acknowledge and integrate Indigenous cultural norms (e.g., protocols around discussing death and gendered perspectives).
- Truth-telling mechanisms, rather than legal commissions, may be more appropriate for addressing historical injustices.
- Structural reform is necessary beyond policy recommendations—there must be binding obligations for government implementation.
(b) According to Marchetti, what steps did the RCIADIC take to ‘include an Indigenous “presence” or voices and to make [its] practices more culturally appropriate’?
- Despite the appointment of an Indigenous commissioner (Patrick Dodson) and the establishment of Aboriginal Issues Units (AIUs), Indigenous perspectives were often disregarded or reshaped to fit legalistic frameworks.
- Failure to Incorporate Indigenous Knowledge and Cultural Sensitivities
- Testimonies from Indigenous communities were undervalued if they did not meet Western evidentiary standards.
- Gendered Indigenous experiences were silenced, particularly regarding women’s deaths, family violence, and systemic abuse.
- Cultural protocols around discussing death were ignored, causing distress and alienation among Indigenous communities.
(c) Explain the concept of ‘deep colonizing’
- reinforced colonial legal structures and marginalized Indigenous perspectives.
(d) Why does Marchetti conclude that the steps taken by RCAISIC ‘continued the colonization of Indigenous people’?
- The inquiry’s methods, although appearing inclusive, failed to challenge existing institutional racism.
- Despite the appointment of an Indigenous commissioner (Patrick Dodson) and the establishment of Aboriginal Issues Units (AIUs), Indigenous perspectives were often disregarded or reshaped to fit legalistic frameworks.
- Legal professionals (mostly non-Indigenous) dominated the process, marginalizing Indigenous staff and community voices.
- Failure to Incorporate Indigenous Knowledge and Cultural Sensitivities
- Testimonies from Indigenous communities were undervalued if they did not meet Western evidentiary standards.
- Gendered Indigenous experiences were silenced, particularly regarding women’s deaths, family violence, and systemic abuse.
- Cultural protocols around discussing death were ignored, causing distress and alienation among Indigenous communities.
(e) What modifications (if any) could future Royal Commissions and other administrative accountability bodies make to their processes to avoid the ‘colonization’ Marchetti identifies and describes?
- Future inquiries should centre Indigenous knowledge, voices, and leadership rather than filtering them through Western legal structures.
- Legal processes must acknowledge and integrate Indigenous cultural norms (e.g., protocols around discussing death and gendered perspectives).
- Truth-telling mechanisms, rather than legal commissions, may be more appropriate for addressing historical injustices.
- Structural reform is necessary beyond policy recommendations—there must be binding obligations for government implementation.
3 Accountability for Robodebt
You will learn more about “Robodebt” in Week 11. This week’s lectures and readings have touched on the role played by a number of accountability bodies in relation to Robodebt: the Ombudsman, the Robodebt Royal Commission and the NACC. Based on what you’ve learned this week, answer the following questions:
(a)  How effective was the Ombudsman in its accountability function? In your view, what other action or approach should the Ombudsman have taken based on its available powers?
- “What is depressingly clear... is that the Ombudsman’s Office was not able to fulfill its role in exposing maladministration over the almost three years it investigated Robodebt complaints; it took litigation to do that. Individuals who were the victims of unfair debt raising could not look to the Ombudsman’s Office for relief.”
- Should have raised it up the chain by the second appointment of the ombudsman
(b) Why did the NACC elect not to pursue action in relation to Robodebt? Do you think this was the right decision? Why/why not?
- Accepted DHS claims regarding legality Removed draft text raising concerns regarding legality
- Influenced (even "co-written? ") by DHS
- Rush job: concern to assist current complainants and complete during Acting Ombudsman's term 
Recent update
In October 2024, the Inspector of NACC reported on an investigation

finding that the Commissioner had engaged in misconduct in handling his conflict of interest and recommended that the Commissioner delegate the function under s 41(5) of the NACC Act to an appropriate person, in other words a delegate should reconsider whether or how to deal with the referrals from the Royal Commission into to the Robodebt Scheme. In a media release

in February 2025, NACC announced that a delegate had reconsidered this issue and decided that it will conduct an investigation in relation to the referrals. 


## Week 4: FOI Requests and Merit Review

### Tutorial questions

In this week's tutorial we look at access to information in Australia's freedom of information regimes.
1 FOI and Robodebt
FOI featured in the Robodebt saga, with a number of requests being made for access to government documents regarding the Robodebt scheme. The government frequently relied on exemptions to refuse access to various documents, including the ‘cabinet documents’ exemption: Freedom of Information Act 1980 (Cth) s 34. One applicant challenged an FOI refusal on that ground all the way to the Full Court of the Federal Court, which handed down a decision in July 2024 agreeing that this exemption had been improperly applied: Warren v CEO, Services Australia [2024] FCAFC 73
Read this news article as well as paragraphs [142] – [143] of the Warren judgment, and answer the following questions:
(a) What is the purpose of the ‘cabinet documents’ exemption in s 34 of the FOI Act? When should it apply? (Note: for additional help with this question, you may find it useful to briefly review the relevant passages in the FOI Guidelines paragraphs [5.63] – [5.94])
- In Patrick and Secretary, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (Freedom of Information) [2021] AATA 2719 (‘Patrick’), White J set out the factors his Honour considered in deciding whether Minutes and notes of the ‘National Cabinet’, established in March 2020, were exempt under s 34 of the FOI Act on the basis that National Cabinet was a ‘committee of the Cabinet’. The factors considered include the way National Cabinet was established, its composition, historical precedent, the discretion and control available to the Prime Minister with respect to National Cabinet, the way National Cabinet operated and its relationship with the Cabinet, as well as collective responsibility and solidarity within the National Cabinet. In Patrick, his Honour found that the National Cabinet, which consisted of the Prime Minister and State and Territory Premiers and Chief Ministers, did not constitute ‘a committee of the Cabinet’ for the purposes of s 34 of the FOI Act. 
- The ‘cabinet documents’ exemption under s 34 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOI Act) is designed to protect the confidentiality of Cabinet deliberations and decision-making processes. The exemption ensures that:
  - Cabinet confidentiality is preserved, maintaining the principle of collective ministerial responsibility.
  - Ministers can freely debate and discuss policy without concern that internal discussions will be publicly disclosed.
  - Sensitive government policy development remains protected, particularly where disclosure could undermine governmental decision-making.
- This exemption is a class-based exemption, meaning that if a document falls within the defined category of ‘Cabinet documents’, it is automatically exempt from disclosure, regardless of its actual content.
- According to s 34 of the FOI Act and the FOI Guidelines ([5.63] – [5.94]), the exemption applies when a document:
  - Has been prepared for submission to Cabinet (including Cabinet committees) for consideration (§34(1)(a)).
  - Is an official record of a Cabinet decision (§34(1)(b)).
  - Was created for the dominant purpose of briefing a Minister for Cabinet deliberations (§34(1)(c)).
  - Would reveal a Cabinet discussion or decision that has not been officially disclosed (§34(3)).
- In Warren v CEO, Services Australia [2024] FCAFC 73, the Full Court of the Federal Court found that:
  - The government improperly applied the Cabinet documents exemption under s 34.
  - The refused documents did not genuinely relate to Cabinet deliberations in a way that justified exemption.
  - The dominant purpose test was not met, meaning the documents should have been released.
(b) What does the history of this case tell us about the potential limitations of FOI legislation in securing government transparency?
1. Overuse and Misuse of Exemptions to Avoid Disclosure
- The Cabinet documents exemption (s 34 FOI Act) is intended to protect sensitive government deliberations.
- However, Warren demonstrates how agencies can misuse this exemption to block access to politically sensitive documents—even when those documents do not genuinely fall within Cabinet deliberations.
- The broad and discretionary nature of FOI exemptions allows government bodies to resist disclosure, undermining the Act’s purpose of transparency.
2. Delays in the FOI Process Undermine Timely Accountability
- FOI requests are often delayed by bureaucratic processes, refusals, internal reviews, and legal challenges.
- In Warren, the applicant had to escalate the challenge to the Full Court of the Federal Court, which required significant time, effort, and legal resources.
- This means that even if a requester eventually wins access, the delay reduces the document's political relevance, limiting its impact on government accountability.
3. Asymmetric Power Between Government and FOI Applicants
- Government agencies have greater resources, legal teams, and expertise in handling FOI requests.
- Individuals, journalists, and advocacy groups often lack the financial and legal resources to challenge refusals.
- The FOI process places the burden on the applicant to prove why information should be disclosed, rather than requiring agencies to justify secrecy to a higher standard.
(c) Is FOI an effective tool to support litigation against government? Why/why not?
- FOI can be a useful tool in litigation against the government, but it has significant limitations that reduce its reliability as a legal strategy. While successful FOI requests can uncover crucial evidence, government agencies have considerable discretion to withhold, delay, or limit access to requested documents, making FOI an uncertain method for obtaining information in legal disputes.
- Why FOI Is an Unreliable Tool for Litigation Against the Government
  - 🚨 Government Agencies Can Use Exemptions to Deny Access
  - Agencies can refuse disclosure based on broad FOI Act exemptions, including:
    - Cabinet documents exemption (s 34 FOI Act) – blocks access to documents related to government decision-making.
    - Public interest immunity (s 47C FOI Act) – allows agencies to refuse disclosure if it could harm government functioning.
    - Legal professional privilege (s 42 FOI Act) – prevents access to government legal advice.
  - Even if an FOI request should be granted, agencies may misapply exemptions, forcing applicants to engage in lengthy legal challenges.
  - 📌 Example: In Warren v CEO, Services Australia, the government wrongly applied the Cabinet documents exemption, delaying access and forcing litigation.
2 Environmental Defenders
Environmental Defenders Inc is an incorporated association. It seeks access under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) to certain ‘internal working documents’ of the Department of Environment and Energy. The documents include Ministerial Briefings prepared by senior public servants, communications between Ministers, communications with Ministers in State Environment portfolios, and communications from junior to senior officers containing comments and suggestions. Some of the documents originated from outside the Department.
The Department has refused access to the request, indicating that for some of the documents: (1) release would not be in the public interest; (2) the applicant would misunderstand the information contained in the documents; and (3) the documents would cause embarrassment to the Government.
(a) Advise Environmental Defenders Inc on whether the Department erred and they should be allowed access to these documents (consider what additional facts you might need to know about these documents to assess this).
- Issue
  - The issue is whether Environmental Defenders Inc (EDI) has a right to access the requested documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOI Act).
  - The Department of Environment and Energy has refused access, citing:
    - Public interest concerns (s 11B).
    - Misinterpretation by the public (not a valid FOI exemption).
    - Embarrassment to the government (not a valid FOI exemption).
- Determine Whether the FOI Act Applies
  - Department
    - The Department of Environment and Energy is a Commonwealth agency under s 4 FOI Act, so it is subject to FOI requests.
    - EDI, as an incorporated association, qualifies as a "person" under s 11(1) and can make an FOI request.
  - Are the documents "of an agency"?
    - Ministerial briefings, intergovernmental communications, and internal documents are all potentially covered under s 4 FOI Act.
    - However, some documents originated externally—additional facts are needed to determine if they are still under the Department’s "constructive possession" (Beesley v Australian Federal Police (2001) 111 FCR 1).
- FOI Exemptions
  - Under s 11A(5), intergovernmental communications (s 47B), Deliberative process documents (s 47C), or Agency operations (s 47E) require a public interest test
  - Public Interest Test
    - Public interest factors in favour of disclosure (s 11B(3)):
      - Promotes transparency and accountability (s 3(2)).
      - Enhances scrutiny of government expenditure.
    - Against disclosure (s 11B(4)):
      - ❌ Government embarrassment is explicitly irrelevant (s 11B(4)(a)).
      - ❌ Misinterpretation concerns are explicitly irrelevant (s 11B(4)(b)).
      - If some documents originated externally, the question is whether the Department has possession or control.
        - Possession includes constructive possession (Beesley v AFP – agency must have a right to deal with the document).
- Consider Partial Access (Redaction & Practical Refusals)
  - If only parts of documents are exempt, the agency must provide a redacted version under s 22 FOI Act.
  - If requests are too broad or burdensome, agencies can refuse on practical refusal grounds (s 24 FOI Act), but must first consult the applicant.
- Conclusion – Possible Outcomes
  - EDI is likely entitled to access some or all of the documents.
  - Public interest concerns raised by the Department are invalid.
  - Ministerial briefings may be subject to the deliberative process exemption, but must still pass the public interest test.
  - Cabinet documents, if any, are conclusively exempt.
  - Redacted access should be considered under s 22.
(b) What avenues of review may be available?
- EDI can challenge the refusal through the following mechanisms:
  - 1. Internal Review (s 54 FOI Act)
    - Request review by the Department itself within 30 days.
  - 2. Information Commissioner Review (s 54L FOI Act)
    - Independent review of the Department’s decision.
    - The IC can affirm, vary, or set aside the decision (s 55K FOI Act).
  - 3. AAT Review (s 57A FOI Act)
    - If dissatisfied with the IC’s decision, appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
  - 4. Judicial Review (Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth))
    - If the Department misinterpreted the FOI Act or breached procedural fairness, EDI can seek review in the Federal Court.
    - Recent example: Warren v Services Australia [2024] FCAFC 73 – the Federal Court ruled procedural unfairness where the agency changed its legal position mid-hearing.
3 The Australian liquor industry
In December last year, the Australian Liquor Corporation, a government corporation for liquor marketing and research, decided to prepare a three year “Export Marketing Strategy” aimed at doubling exports of Australian liquor, with particular emphasis on the export of gin to North America. The Minister, Henry Button, has indicated that he is “fully behind the Corporation in its endeavour to increase exports worldwide”.
In March, the Corporation sent a team of five Directors on a three month trip overseas to get “firsthand knowledge” of American and Canadian markets. They also commissioned market research company Markets R Us Pty Ltd to undertake surveys of the existing markets in both countries and target opportunities for expansion.
The team of Directors returned from their trip somewhat ‘dispirited’ by the state of the markets in both countries. They prepared a detailed report, which concludes:
competition in America and Canada is so strong that there would not be sufficient return on the investment to justify the huge advertising campaigns being considered in those countries. There would be little likelihood of major market gains in the short term.
The Minister is not very happy with these conclusions because he has already given several media conferences publicising the “expected huge increase in gin sales, particularly to North America”. Consequently, he wants the report “kept under wraps until Australian liquor companies get some big orders elsewhere and the announcement will be less damaging”. The Corporation issues a media release stating that it has been advised of the team’s findings and will modify future marketing strategies accordingly.
The market research by Markets R Us Pty Ltd is even less hopeful, predicting no real prospect of Australian exports finding a foothold in either the United States or Canada. Amy Higgins (one of the directors of Markets R Us Pty Ltd) is friends with Peter Juniper, owner of a boutique gin distillery in the Hunter Valley. Worried about the findings, Amy mentions to Peter that the research “was a bit of a fizzer”.
On reading the research report, the Corporation is somewhat embarrassed when they realise that they have spent $550,000 on research which duplicates the findings of an earlier study by the French Government conducted two years earlier. The Corporation advises Amy that the report is confidential and to refer any inquiries about it to the Corporation’s public relations officer. Unfortunately, Peter Juniper has already told several others in the industry of the conversation with Amy.
The Corporation begins to receive FOI applications from Australian distilleries and the media. It also receives requests from representatives of the New Zealand industry, who want to confirm the results of the survey before developing their own marketing strategies. The Corporation has been asked for the market research report and “all documents relating to the overseas fact-finding mission by the Directors of the Corporation including any reports of their findings or conclusions”.
The Corporation is keen to protect its internal reputation and the Minister wants to avoid embarrassment for his government.
Are there any exemptions that the Corporation might rely upon to justify withholding the documents?
- Step 1
  - Who may access
    - s 11(1)(a) - anyone may access a document of an agency that is not exempt
    - Is the Australian liquor Corporation an agency
      - Department means a Department of the Australian Public Service that corresponds to a Department of State of the Commonwealth.
      - An agency includes prescribed authorities
        - Body established for a public purpose by legislation / order: s 4 def., (a)
        - Person holding office established by legislation / order: s 4 def., (c)
        - Bodies/persons specified in regulations: s 4 def., (b)-(d)
    - There’s no evidence that the Australian Liquor Corporation is a prescribed authority created by legislation
  - Step 2: What is Being Requested?
    - Documents Requested:
      - Market research report by Markets R Us Pty Ltd.
      - Documents relating to the fact-finding mission, including:
        - Reports.
        - Findings.
        - Conclusions.
    - Are these "Documents of an Agency" (s 4 FOI Act)?
      - Beesley v AFP (2001) 111 FCR 1: A document is “of an agency” if:
        - It is in the possession of the agency; or
        - The agency has a right to access and use the document, even if it is held externally (constructive possession).
    - Fact-finding report (Directors)	
      - Possession- held by Corporation.	
      - FOI Applies.
    - Markets R Us report (Consultants)	
      - Possession- paid for by Corporation.	
      - FOI Applies under s 6C FOI Act (constructive possession).
    - Verbal conversation (Amy Higgins → Peter Juniper)	
      - No Possession —not recorded.	
      - FOI Does not apply, verbal statements are not “documents” (s 4 FOI Act).
