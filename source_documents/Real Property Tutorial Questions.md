## Week 2: Tenure and Estates; Native Title; and Fixtures

Tutorial Questions (No pre-preparation question is due this week.)
Dealing with Land
- What do we mean when we talk about 'Land'?
  - The surface of the earth
  - Fixtures (things attached to the land, such as buildings)
  - The airspace above the land (limited to a height necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of the land)
  - The substrata (soil, minerals, and space beneath the land)
- Can people own land?
    - In a sense, fee simple allows it, but under the doctrine of tenure, all land in Australia remains ultimately owned by the Crown. 
    - The holder of a fee simple estate has perpetual and exclusive possession, but they do not hold absolute title in the way that private ownership is understood in some other legal systems.
- What does it mean for land to be governed under old system rather than torrens title? Why is it relevant today?
    - Old System title still affects some properties, making it relevant for land transactions, historical claims, and legal disputes.
      - Requires an unbroken chain of historical ownership
    - (a) Conversion to Torrens Title
      - Many Old System properties are gradually being converted to Torrens title under land titling laws.
      - When land under Old System title is sold, mortgaged, or subdivided, it often must be converted to Torrens title.
    - (b) Proving Ownership in Disputes
      - If someone claims ownership over land that was never formally transferred to Torrens title, they may need to prove ownership through old deeds.
      - This is important for adverse possession claims (i.e., squatters' rights), boundary disputes, and family inheritance cases.
    - (c) Legal Risks for Buyers
      - If a property is still under Old System title, conveyancers must check historical records carefully to ensure there are no missing deeds or ownership disputes.
- Why do we refer to a 'bundle of rights'? What rights can apply to land?
    - The purchase of a selection of rights related to land to the exclusion of all others under specific conditions
    - The estates in land
      - the fee simple
      - the life estate 
      - Leasehold
    - The lesser interests – known as servitudes in the civil law jurisdictions 
      - Easements
      - profits à prendre 
      - restrictive covenants. 
    - Security Interests 
      - Mortgages
      - charges 
- What is the difference between Rights in Rem and Rights in Personam? Give some examples.
    - In personam - contractual rights and such (against a person)
      - Contractual rights
      - A tortious award claim
    - In rem - right to use, control, or dispose of a specific property (against a thing)
      - The right to possess property
      - The right to use property
      - The right to sell property
      - The right to transfer ownership of property
Tenure and Estates
- Define a freehold interest. How does it differ from leasehold interests?
  - Freehold interest: a permanent interest in land that gives the owner the right to use and control the property.
  - Leasehold interest: an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a lessee or a tenant has rights of real property by some form of title from a lessor or landlord.
  - Difference: one is the right to own, the other is the right to hold or use
- What are the two forms of life estate? How do we tell the difference?
    - Two types: Life estate and life estate pur autre vie
    - Life estate: To Maggie
    - Life estate pur autre vie: To Maggie for the life of Bella
- How does a reversion differ from a remainder?
    - Estate in reversion
      - To Alice for life
      - What happens when A dies?
      - Reverts to the grantor.
      - Grantor has a fee simple in reversion
      - The grantor and Alice have simultaneous estates. 
      - They both exist at the same time. Alice’s estate is in possession
    - Estate in remainder def
      - a type of ownership in real estate that someone will have in the future
      - If there are conditions, no interest arrises until the conditions are met
- Consider the following grants: who has what interest?
  - To Russell for life, remainder to Harold.  
      - Russel: life estate, Harol: Remainder interest
  - To Jimmy for life. 
      - Life estate, Grantor(or Heirs): Reversion, no remainder specified
  - In a grant made by Ginny: To Bobby forever. Ginny dies before Bobby.
      - Bobby: fee simple, Grace: No remaining interest
  - To John and his heirs. 
      - Fee simple
Native Title
- What is Native Title? Is it unique to Australia?
    - the recognition by the common law of rights and interests that are sourced in a normative system (we would now say another sovereign system I think) which pre-existed British sovereignty
    - Unique to australia
- What is needed to be proven to establish a successful Native Title claim?
    - Native Title def
      - Content is variable
      - Depends on the facts
      - Evidence to determine the laws and customs in each individual case
      - ‘continuous connection’
      - Communal not individual
      - Not an institution of the common law
    - Whose evidence?
      - Traditional owners – elders
      - Anthropologists
      - Archaeologists
      - Historians
      - (and also drawn from government departments, such as Crown Lands or NSW Land Registry Services)
- Read Attorney-General v Brown. Compare the way in which the Court in this case characterises and describes the doctrine of tenure with Brennan J’s approach in Mabo (No. 2). How was the Crown’s interest in land characterised in each decision? How similar were the underlying arguments presented to the Court?
    - In Attorney-General v Brown (1847), the Court held that upon settlement, all land in the colony vested absolutely in the Crown, applying a rigid feudal doctrine without recognising pre-existing Indigenous rights. In contrast, Brennan J in Mabo (No. 2) (1992) reinterpreted the doctrine of tenure, holding that the Crown acquired only radical title, allowing for the recognition of native title where it had not been lawfully extinguished. While both cases applied feudal tenure, Mabo (No. 2) rejected terra nullius and acknowledged Indigenous land rights, fundamentally shifting the legal framework.
    - Brown = absolute ownership by the Crownn (absolute tenure) vs Mabo (Brennan) = radical title (sovereignty) + tenure (Crown can grant interests but must respect native title unless extinguished)
- Why does an estate in fee simple extinguish Native Title?
  - Fejo: a grant of fee simple is wholly inconsistent with native title and permanently extinguishes it.
  - Established that native title does not "revive" when land returns to Crown ownership.
  - native title is extinguished when rights granted by the Crown are inconsistent with its continued existence
## Week 3: The Torrens System

Tutorial Questions 
Indefeasibility 
- What does it mean when we describe Torrens as a system of ‘title by registration’? 
  - The Torrens system is described as a system of "title by registration" because legal ownership of land is conferred by the act of registration itself, rather than by historical claims of ownership or a chain of title, meaning that a registered proprietor's title is guaranteed and not dependent on prior documents.d
- How do we transact in land under Torrens (ie. what is the process for selling land)? 
  - How do we transfer an estate?
    - Two parties enter into a contract for sale.
      - On a nominated day, the contracts are exchanged, and the purchaser pays a deposit. The parties are bound by the contract. This means that the contract is specifically enforceable by the purchaser.
      - In equity, the purchaser is deemed the owner (this is known as the doctrine of conversion) , but the legal estate does not pass until registration.
    - A date is nominated for settlement. The purchase money will be transferred on this day, and the incoming purchaser will be registered as the owner.
      - The conveyance occurs electronically.
      - On 11 October 2021, new changes to our titling system were introduced.
        - The Real Property Amendment (Certificates of Title) Act 2021 allows for cancelling CTs and moving NSW to 100% electronic lodgement of land transactions.
- What is the concept of indefeasibility? How does it operate? 
  - It operates by virtue of section 42.
    - An indefeasible title is one that is conclusive.
    - An indefeasible title is one that cannot be set aside due to a defect existing in that title prior to its registration.
    - If one has an indefeasible estate or interest then that estate or interest is held free from all other interests that are not on the register (unless there is an exception)
- Does a Volunteer benefit from indefeasibility? Why? What is the rationale for the NSW position? How might we explain the differences in other jurisdictions (such as Victoria)? 
    - Volunteers
      - A volunteer is one who does not provide valuable consideration.
      - Can a registered proprietor who is a volunteer receive the benefits of indefeasibility?
      - This varies considerably across the states and is still quite controversial.
      - Although the decision is not without its critics, in Bogdanovic v Koteff (1988) 12 NSWLR 472 the NSWCA held that, in NSW, volunteers gain indefeasibility on registration.
    -  the rationale is that the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) does not explicitly limit indefeasibility to purchasers for value, whereas jurisdictions like Victoria reject this on policy grounds, prioritising commercial certainty and preventing windfalls to donees.
- While registration can cure documents void for formalities, can it cure registration of an interest with a substantive defect? How was this reflected in Bursill Enterprises v Berger Bros?
  - No, registration cannot cure an interest with a substantive defect, as seen in Bursill Enterprises v Berger Bros (1971) 124 CLR 73, where the High Court held that while an interest recorded in the register gains indefeasibility, the registered interest must still be valid in substance—here, the purported easement was not a true easement but a proprietary right, and because it was not properly notified on the register, it was not binding on the subsequent registered proprietor.
- Does a potential purchaser or mortgagee need to search beyond the register? Why/why not? 
  - A potential purchaser or mortgagee generally does not need to search beyond the register because the Torrens system operates on the curtain principle, meaning that all relevant interests should be recorded on the register, and the registered proprietor holds title free from unregistered interests (Real Property Act 1900 (NSW), s 42). However, Bursill Enterprises v Berger Bros (1971) 124 CLR 73 demonstrated that in cases where an interest is ambiguously recorded, a prudent purchaser may need to inspect the instrument behind the transfer to determine the full nature and extent of rights affecting the land.
Exceptions to Indefeasibility 
7. What are the categories of statutory exceptions to indefeasibility? When can they apply? What would be the most relevant in practice?
  - Section 42(1)(a) Prior Folio
    - Where an earlier title has already been created for the same interest in land
      - E.g. two folios for the same land.
        - This might happen where a parcel of land is subdivided into two parcels, one subdivision is sold off and a folio created in respect of that parcel. Subsequently, the second subdivision is sold, but the folio created for that parcel includes not only the second subdivided parcel, but also part or the whole of the first parcel.
      - E.g. Two folios where there is an overlap between the two lots of land
    - The prior folio will prevail
    - Consider possible overlap with section 42(1)(c)
  - Section 42(1)(a1) Omitted or misdescribed easements
    - Where an easement has been omitted from or misdescribed on the folio, it may be an exception to indefeasibility.
    - This is actually a very narrow exception and can rarely be invoked.
      - E.g. Mistakes during conversion from Old System to Torrens, pre-existing prescriptive easements etc
  - Section 42(1)(b) Omitted or misdescribed profits à prendre
    - This is a counterpart to s 42(1)(a1)
    - It is also very narrow and will be discussed in the topic on easements
  - Section 42(1)(c) Wrong description of boundaries
    - This exception applies when surveying mistakes are made and land is included in the folio which was not intended to be included by the parties.
      - Where land has been included in a grant, certificate or folio by the wrong description of parcels or boundaries, then title to that land remains with the original owner
      - It covers land intended to be included but which was misdescribed
      - It does not include land that was correctly described but did not belong to the applicant and should never have been included.
    - The exception does not operate against a later purchaser for valuable consideration or deriving from or through such a purchaser (this seriously limits the scope of the exception)
  - Section 42(1)(d) Short-term Leases
    - This covers leases of less than three years (including option to renew)
    - In possession or the lessee is entitled to immediate possession
    - Purchaser of the reversion takes with notice of the tenant’s interest (at the time of settlement)
      - Notice can be either actual or constructive
    - We will revisit this in the topic on leases
8. How does the fraud exception operate? What does it mean when we say the fraud ‘must be brought home’ to the registered proprietor? 
- Mere knowledge of the fraud by the agent is not enough.
  - That knowledge must be brought home (ie imputed) to the principal.
  - The agent’s express knowledge is imputable. Constructive notice to the agent is insufficient.
  - Thus, actual knowledge of fraud by the agent will be presumed to bind the principal.
9. What types of fraud are possible when transacting land? 
When transacting land under the Torrens system, the following types of fraud can occur:
- Forgery – A party fraudulently signs or alters a document without proper authority (e.g., Frazer v Walker [1967] 1 AC 569).
- False Attestation – A person falsely witnesses a signature, often leading to fraudulent registration (e.g., Schultz v Corwill Properties (1969) 90 WN 529).
- Fraudulent Misrepresentation – A seller or registered proprietor knowingly makes false statements to induce a sale (e.g., Loke Yew v Port Swettenham [1913] AC 491).
- Fraud on the Registrar-General – A party knowingly submits false information to deceive the Registrar-General into registering an invalid interest.
- Fraud by an Agent – Fraudulent conduct by an authorised agent can be imputed to the principal if it occurs within the scope of their authority (e.g., Cassegrain v Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd [2015] HCA 2).
- Wilful Blindness – A party deliberately avoids making inquiries into possible fraud when reasonable suspicion exists (e.g., Assets Co v Mere Roihi [1905] AC 176).
10. We often speak of the registered proprietor having notice of fraud. What type of notice is required, and is mere notice enough to bring the fraud home? 
  - Fraud for Torrens is often referred to as ‘statutory fraud’
    - Torrens Fraud is based on sections 42 and 43 (which excludes mere notice as constituting fraud).
    - So, the estate or interest of a registered proprietor (unless fraudulent) will defeat unregistered interests even where they have actual or constructive notice.
  - Elsewhere, you can argue narrow forms of fraud at common law (eg. deceit or fraudulent misrepresentation), but fraud under Torrens is broader.
  - You can can also argue fraud in equity (equitable fraud).
    - Equitable fraud is based on notice and is broader than Torrens fraud.
    - Its application to law is thus constrained by section 43
11. Who must the fraud be committed against?
- Fraud against Whom
  - The fraud by the registered proprietor must have been against the party seeking to assert an interest
  - However, it may also be sufficient for section 42 if the registered proprietor has obtained registration by a fraud practiced against the Registrar-General
    - Cases in this category usually arose in the context of mortgages – eg where a bank employee falsely certifies that a mortgage was signed in her presence knowing that the mortgage is to be submitted to the Registrar-General for registration (ie a false attestation or misrepresentation that induced the Registrar to act). See, eg, Australian Guarantee Corp v De Jager [1984] VR 483.
    - This is now substantively covered by section 56C and will be discussed when we look at mortgages.
12. What is the remedy when fraud is successfully established? 
- Causes of Action
  - A cause of action a set of pre-defined elements which allow a person to argue for a remedy in court
    - You have studied some in contract law, and will also study some in equity and trusts:
      - E.g. misrepresentation, mistake, unconscionable conduct, undue influence and duress, some forms of estoppel, breach of trust
    - Don’t confuse causes of action with remedies: eg damages; specific performance etc
13. Define what it means to have a claim in personam? 
- In Personam Exception to Indefeasibility
  - Claims In personam
    - An in personam right arises by virtue of an obligation created by the registered proprietor:
      - A plaintiff can bring a claim ‘against a registered proprietor a claim in personam, founded in law or in equity, for such relief as a court acting in personam may grant’ - Frazer v Walker at 585
      - Sometimes also called ‘personal equities’ (eg Breskvar v Wall)
      - Registration does not extinguish obligations incurred by a registered proprietor
      - The obligations can be legal or equitable
      - They can arise before or after registration
      - The scope of the exception is unclear and of continuing controversy
Problem Question 
14. Sarah is the registered proprietor of a waterfront property known as "Seaview Villa." The property includes a luxurious beachfront house and a furnished guest cottage. There is a registered easement on the title in favour of the neighbouring property owner, John, granting him access to a private dock on Sarah's land. 
Sarah, an art collector, holds the land on trust for herself and her two siblings, Michael and Emily. They acquired the property a few years ago with the intention of converting it into an art gallery and event space. Unfortunately, a recent falling out has occurred among the siblings over the property's use. 
Sarah decides to lease the guest cottage to Lily without informing her siblings. The lease is for a period of two years, with no option to renew. The lease agreement is not registered, and Lily moves in without any issues. 
Sarah then decides to sell the entire property, including the main house and the guest cottage, to Robert for $1.5 million. Robert inspects the property before the contract exchange and finds the house unoccupied (might be mere notice). Robert walks around the guest house but, without making any further inquiries, assumes the furniture inside belongs to Sarah.  
After the contract exchange but before the settlement, Robert meets Emily, one of Sarah's siblings, at a local art exhibition. During their conversation, Emily, who has been drinking numerous glasses of champagne, mentions that she and Michael have visited a lawyer and are drawing up documents to dissolve their partnership with Sarah. Emily further tells Robert that she and Michael plan to transform Seaview Villa into a high-end art gallery and have had an architect design plans they will submit to the council for planning approval as soon as the partnership is dissolved. (likely actual knowledge) 
The following day, Robert instructs his legal team to expedite the settlement, and it goes through successfully, with the property transfer registered in his name. 
After the settlement, Robert discovers that Lily is residing in the guest cottage and that she insists on staying for the full two years of her lease. 
Robert seeks legal advice on the following: 
- Can Robert erect a fence across the easement to prevent John from accessing the private dock on his property? 
  - No
    - The easement is registered, meaning it binds Robert as the new registered proprietor under s 42(1) of the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW).
    - Registered easements run with the land and are enforceable against subsequent purchasers.
    - Blocking the easement would be an interference with John's legal rights.
- Can Robert legally evict Lily from the guest cottage before the end of her two-year lease? 
  - Short-term leases (less than three years) are an exception to indefeasibility under s 42(1)(d) of the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW).
  - Even though the lease was unregistered, Lily is in possession, giving her an enforceable right.
  - Since Robert did not inquire about Lily’s occupancy, he is bound by her lease.
- Can Michael and Emily claim rectification of the register or argue that Robert holds the property as trustee for them, based on the assertion that he was fraudulent in completing the purchase while being aware of their intent to use the land as an art gallery? 
  - The key issue is whether Robert's conduct amounted to fraud under s 42(1).
  - Actual fraud requires dishonesty or moral turpitude (as per Assets Co v Mere Roihi [1905] AC 176 and Bahr v Nicolay (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 604).
  - Robert had actual knowledge of Michael and Emily’s equitable interest and their intentions before settlement.
  - Expediting settlement after learning of their claim could indicate a dishonest intent to deprive them of their interest.
  - This raises the possibility of fraud or an in personam claim, allowing Michael and Emily to seek rectification or establish a constructive trust.
  - Step 1: Identify the Key Issue
    - The argument is about exceptions to statutory indefeasibility (fraud, in personam claims, statutory exceptions)?
  - Step 2: Determine the Registered Proprietor’s Rights
    - Check the register:
      - Who is the current registered proprietor?
        - Becomes robert
      - Are there any interests recorded on the folio? (s 42(1) Real Property Act 1900 (NSW))
        - Yes, the easement in favour of John is registered.
        - No registered trust, but Sarah holds the land on trust for Michael and Emily, creating an equitable interest
  - Apply Indefeasibility Principle:
    - The registered proprietor holds indefeasible title, meaning they take free from unregistered interests unless an exception applies.
    - Is it a case of immediate (Frazer v Walker; Breskvar v Wall) or deferred indefeasibility (Gibbs v Messer)?
      - Probably immediate indefeasability
    - If there is fraud, when did it occur? Who committed it?
      - Robert knowingly accelerated the deal after hearing a potential issue with the registered proprieter’s authority or claim to the property
  - Step 3: Apply the Exceptions to Indefeasibility
    - Fraud Exception (s 42(1))
      - Is there actual fraud? (Dishonesty/moral turpitude)
        - yes
      - Was the fraud brought home to the registered proprietor (Cassegrain v Cassegrain)?
        - Not directly, since he didn’t make a false representation or forge a document.
        - However, he may be liable for wilful blindness or constructive fraud.
      - Was there wilful blindness or constructive fraud (Assets Co v Mere Roihi)?
        - Yes—he knew of a competing claim and deliberately ignored it to secure registration.
        - Courts have held this sufficient for fraud.
    - Statutory Exceptions (s 42(1)(a)-(d))
      - Short-term lease (<3 years) where the tenant is in possession.
        - For lil, not relevant here
    - In Personam Exception
      - Is there a known cause of action (breach of contract, trust, unconscionable conduct)?
        - Maybe Breach of trusts here
      - Did the registered proprietor assume a personal obligation enforceable against them? (Mercantile Mutual v Gosper)
        - No?
  - Step 4: Consider Unregistered Interests
    - Does the claimant have a mere equity or an equitable interest? (Barry v Heider)
      - Equitable interest
    - Is there an overriding equitable principle (such as estoppel or constructive trust)?
      - Constructive trust
  - Step 5: Determine Priorities (if competing interests exist)
    - If two parties claim rights over the land, who has the better equitable interest? (Breskvar v Wall)
      - Prior beneficiaries (trust)?
    - If both have equitable interests, use priority rules:
      - First in time usually prevails (but subject to equities).
        - Claimants are first in time
      - A bona fide purchaser for value without notice takes free from prior equitable interests.
        - A bona fide purchaser for value without notice would take free—but Robert had notice.
## Week 4: Torrens II

Tutorial Held in Week Commencing: 10 March 2025
Torrens Assurance Fund 
- Why is there a need for an Assurance Fund under the Torrens System?
    - Funded by a levy on registrations.
    - Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) s 120(1): Compensation is available for loss due to:
      - Fraud (s 120(1)(a))
      - Errors, misdescriptions, or omissions (s 120(1)(b))
      - Land being brought under the Torrens system (s 120(1)(c))
      - Wrongful registration of another person as proprietor (s 120(1)(d))
- Is it possible for the register to be changed to give someone back an interest?
    - 2.1 If the issue concerns correction of the Register:
      - Relevant Statutes & Case Law:
        - Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) s 12(1)(d): Registrar-General can correct errors or omissions in the Register.
        - s 12(3)(b): Corrections cannot affect rights based on uncorrected entries.
        - s 138(1): Courts have the power to create, cancel, or amend a folio in land recovery cases.
        - Castle Constructions v Sahab Holdings (2013) 247 CLR 149: Corrections are limited to clerical errors, not substantive changes.
- Against whom does action for damages lie where someone has lost their interest in land?
    - An action for damages lies against the fraudulent or negligent party responsible for the loss, but if the land has passed to a bona fide purchaser for value (who has indefeasible title under s 42), the claimant’s only recourse is compensation from the Torrens Assurance Fund under s 120 of the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW).
- In what circumstances is compensation available under the Torrens Assurance Fund? 
    - Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) s 120(1): Compensation is available for loss due to:
      - Fraud (s 120(1)(a))
      - Errors, misdescriptions, or omissions (s 120(1)(b))
      - Land being brought under the Torrens system (s 120(1)(c))
      - Wrongful registration of another person as proprietor (s 120(1)(d))
Caveats and Priority Notices
5. What is the function of a Caveat? 
-  Caveats
  - Definition: A statutory injunction preventing registration of dealings without the caveator’s consent (Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) s 74F).
6. What does it mean to have a caveatable interest? 
- Caveatable Interest
  - It cannot be lodged to protect a mere contractual or personal right, it must be to protect a proprietary interest.
  - The caveatable interest must exist at the time of lodgement.
  - Examples:
    - Interest of a purchaser under a contract for sale;
    - Interest of an equitable mortgagee;
    - Interest of a lessee under a lease or an agreement for a lease;
    - Option to purchase land
7. What are the key differences between caveats and priority notices? 
- Do I lodge a Priority Notice or a Caveat?
  - Priority Notices can provide an easy and cheaper alternative to a Black v Garnock caveat. Although, theoretically, there is nothing to stop a purchaser or an incoming mortgagee in lodging both.
  - A Priority Notice is far more beneficial for use in shorter settlement periods. The standard settlement period is 42 days, but can be longer or shorter. Its use for longer settlement periods beyond 90 days would provide little utility. Parties using a Priority Notice for longer settlement periods should be aware that as it automatically lapses after 60 days, this could allow an unregistered dealing noted on the title to be registered immediately on the lapsing of the Priority Notice. Perhaps a way around this for practitioners might be to lodge a Priority Notice in the 30 days prior to the anticipated settlement, rather than directly after exchange, although, the obvious issue is that the earlier contractual period is left unprotected.
  - Obviously, where there is no dealing to be lodged to give effect to an interest, a Priority Notice would not be suitable.
  - If you have a caveatable interest, it's far more prudent to lodge a caveat than a Priority Notice. As a caveat stays on the title indefinitely (unless it lapses, is withdrawn or by order of the court) it prevents all dealings with the title. Given that achieving lapsing can be complex, and court proceedings expensive and lengthy, a caveat can provide a party with strong protection
8. Do unregistered interest holders always need to lodge a caveat? What happens if they don’t? 
- Unregistered interest holders do not always need to lodge a caveat, but failure to do so can result in loss of priority to later interests. While an unregistered equitable interest is still enforceable (Barry v Heider (1914) 19 CLR 197), failure to lodge a caveat may constitute postponing conduct if a later party acquires an interest without notice and relies on the Register (Abigail v Lapin [1934] AC 491; Heid v Reliance Finance (1983) 154 CLR 326). In such cases, the later equitable interest may take priority over the first in time.
9. What is the appropriate test for determining whether an individual has lodged a caveat honestly and reasonably? 
- Wrongful Caveats: A party who lodges a caveat without reasonable cause may have to pay compensation (s 74P, Horswell v Paull (1983) NSW Conv R 55-126).
 
Pre-preparation question to be handed in
Chris owns a property in fee simple in Lane Cove NSW (“the property”). Chris is in a wheelchair and has a live-in carer, Dee. Chris has one daughter, Carol, who is 22 years old. Chris and Dee have been friends for many years and went to high school together. In 2013, after Chris is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, Dee moves into the property to help take care of him and Carol. Dee drives Chris to all his physiotherapy appointments and cooks and cleans. In 2023, Carol moves out to live with friends in a townhouse in Paddington. Chris is very thankful to Dee who has taken such good care of him and Carol all these years. Chris is also aware that his health is waning. Six months before his death, Chris has a conversation with Dee about the future. Chris’s daughter, Carol, who has come over to visit, is present for this conversation. Chris tells Dee over dinner that after his death she can live in the property for the rest of her life. Carol nods in agreement and says “Dee, you are like family, that’s the least we can do”. When Dee asks if she needs to see a lawyer, Carol tells her that it is not necessary to go to the hassle and expense. The agreement is put in writing, but Dee does not register the document. She reasons that she has a good relationship with Carol who has stated on more than one occasion that she will respect her father’s wishes. Three months after this conversation, Chris’s health significantly deteriorates. Dee, concerned about formalising the agreement, approaches Carol to discuss the situation - she does not want to trouble Chris. Carol reassures Dee that she will honour the life estate when the property eventually passes to her. Chris dies. Carol inherits the property as sole beneficiary under her father's will. Carol registers her interest. Dee remains living in the property as per the agreed arrangement. Four months later, Carol has a falling out with her flatmates and wants to move into the property. She gives Dee two weeks' notice to vacate the premises. Dee is shocked and upset and refuses to move out.
Advise Dee. 
 
Additional practice question for in class discussion only
When Barry’s father, Ricky, passed away, Barry received $950,000 from his estate. Barry immediately set out to invest his inheritance in the property market, believing that to be the safest bet. He did not need extra finance to fund the purchase. Barry purchased a two-bedroom 1960’s house on a small block in Pagewood. 
At the time of purchase, the Pagewood Property was in dire need of renovations. Luckily, Barry had the skills and energy to undertake those renovations himself, completing them to a very high standard. The property was even featured in an article in Belle Décor, praising the integrity and skill evident in the new interior design of the house. Unfortunately, the renovations cost much more than Barry had anticipated. This resulted in the need for him to take out a personal loan from Savings Bank to fully fund his vision.
Six months later, Barry lost his job and quickly came to the conclusion that it was too costly to service the interest on his personal loan. As such, he decided to sell the Pagewood property so that he could pay off the debt completely and move on to other projects.
Barry received an offer from Abbey with whom he proceeded to enter into and exchange a contract for sale. Abbey provided Barry with a 10% deposit and requested an expedited settlement. Barry, happy to receive the funds sooner than he expected, agreed and he assured her that he would proceed with the transfer the following week.
Two weeks passed and Barry realised he hadn’t heard anything more from Abbey. As she had taken no steps to contact him, Barry, who had not updated or removed the online listing of the property, entered into another contract of sale with Debbie, a solicitor, who had made a significantly higher offer after finding the listing.
Unbeknown to Barry, Debbie was Abbey’s sister. At a family dinner that week both Debbie and Abbey excitedly shared the news with their family that each was purchasing a property. It didn’t take long for them to work out that they were talking about the same property and that Barry’s conduct has created some serious issues. Debbie, the older sister, told Abbey not to worry and that she would sort it out.
The next morning, Debbie made contact with Barry, transferred the purchase price for the property and had him sign the necessary transfer documents. Debbie immediately proceeded to register her interest. She is now the registered proprietor.
Did Debbie obtain an indefeasible title?
