  - What are we challenging? Pay close attention to who and what we‚Äôre challenging when there are multiple actions/instruments in the decision-making chain
- In summary, it could be said that three principles underpin the administrative law system: 
  - administrative justice def, which, at its core, is a philosophy that in administrative decision-making the rights and interests of individuals should be properly safeguarded; 
  - executive accountability def, which is the aim of ensuring that those who exercise the executive  (and coercive) powers of the state can be called on to explain and to justify the way in which  they have gone about that task; and 
  - good administration def, which is the principle that administrative decision-making should  conform to universally accepted standards, such as rationality, fairness, consistency and  transparency.
- Adding a fourth integrity branch to three-branch legislative, executive, and judicial model
- Kerr Report (1971)
  - Background & Context:
    - Commissioned in 1968, chaired by Sir John Kerr.
    - Aimed to review Commonwealth administrative law due to concerns about inconsistency, complexity, and lack of accessibility.
    - At the time, judicial review was available under common law and s 75(v) of the Constitution, but was hindered by cost, secrecy, and legal technicalities.
    - Other countries (UK, NZ) had already reformed administrative law, influencing the Committee‚Äôs recommendations.
  - Key Issues Identified:
    - Fragmented and inconsistent administrative review (different tribunals with varying powers and procedures).
    - Judicial review was insufficient ‚Äì legal technicalities and cost limited access.
    - Over-reliance on parliamentary and executive accountability, which was ineffective.
    - Lack of transparency and access to reasons for government decisions.
  - Major Recommendations & Reforms:
    - Judicial Review Reform
      - Led to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), which codified and simplified judicial review procedures.
    - Creation of a General Merits Review Tribunal
      - Established the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) for independent merits review of government decisions.
    - Introduction of the Ombudsman
      - Recommended a government oversight body (Ombudsman Act 1976 (Cth)) to investigate complaints about administrative decisions.
    - Establishment of the Administrative Review Council (ARC)
      - Oversight body to monitor and improve administrative review mechanisms.
    - Proposed Administrative Procedure Act (Not Implemented)
      - Aimed to standardize tribunal procedures across different areas of law.
  - Significance & Impact:
    - Laid the foundation for modern Australian administrative law, enhancing transparency, accountability, and fairness.
    - Established structured judicial and merits review mechanisms.Strengthened individual rights in administrative decision-making.
    - Influenced later reforms, such as the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) and Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
- Craig v Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Freedom of Information Appeal) [2023] AATA 2785 
  - Tribunal: Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)
    - Presiding Member: Deputy President Britten-Jones
    - Date of Decision: 28 August 2023
  - Parties:
    - Applicant: Mr Craig

  - Procedural History:
    - Mr Craig applied for access to an unredacted version of a three-page diplomatic cable (the DFAT Cable) under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOI Act). 
    - DFAT denied full access under s 33(a)(iii) (damage to international relations) and s 33(b) (confidential foreign government communications). 
    - The applicant sought a review by the AAT.
  - Facts:
    - The DFAT Cable (dated 16 November 2007) was sent by Dr Justin Lee (Deputy Head of Mission in Jakarta) to DFAT headquarters in Canberra. 
    - It summarised discussions between Australian and Indonesian officials regarding the NSW Coronial Inquest into the 1975 deaths of the Balibo Five journalists in Indonesia.
    - DFAT partially released the document but redacted portions under s 33(a)(iii) and s 33(b) of the FOI Act.
    - The US diplomatic cable (dated 21 November 2007), published by WikiLeaks and reported in Australian media, allegedly contained similar information.
    - Mr Craig argued that:
      - The DFAT Cable should be disclosed because similar information was already public via WikiLeaks.
      - The FOI Act should not be used to conceal crimes or override higher laws.
      - The Tribunal should examine the document to determine if it contained evidence of misconduct.
      - DFAT relied on the affidavit of Mr Ridwaan Jadwat, asserting that disclosure would harm Australia‚Äôs international relations with Indonesia.
  - Legal Issues:
    - Is the DFAT Cable an "exempt document" under s 33(a)(iii) of the FOI Act?
    - Would disclosure "reasonably be expected to cause damage to the international relations of the Commonwealth"?
    - Does prior public disclosure (via WikiLeaks) remove the exemption under s 33(a)(iii)?
  - Decision:
    - The Tribunal affirmed DFAT‚Äôs decision to deny access.
    - Exemption under s 33(a)(iii) applies:
      - The Tribunal accepted Mr Jadwat‚Äôs evidence that diplomatic communications occur with an expectation of confidentiality.
      - Disclosure would erode trust between Australia and Indonesia and reduce diplomatic cooperation.
      - The Balibo Five issue remains highly sensitive, and disclosure could still harm Australia-Indonesia relations despite the passage of time.
    - WikiLeaks disclosure is irrelevant:
      - The US Cable was a third-party hearsay report, not an official Australian document.
      - Even if accurate, Indonesia would perceive an official Australian disclosure differently from an unauthorised leak.
      - Breach of diplomatic trust‚Äînot just content‚Äîis the key issue.
    - Tribunal's power is limited:
      - The Tribunal can only decide whether the document is exempt under s 33(a)(iii)‚Äînot investigate alleged misconduct.
  - Ratio Decidendi:
    - Confidential diplomatic communications are protected under s 33(a)(iii) of the FOI Act.
    - Even if similar information is leaked by a third party, official disclosure can still harm international relations.
    - The Tribunal lacks discretion to override an exemption once it is satisfied that disclosure "could reasonably be expected" to cause harm.
  - Significance:
    - Reinforces that diplomatic confidentiality is central to international relations and that unauthorised leaks do not negate FOI exemptions.
    - Confirms strict application of FOI exemptions‚Äîpublic interest considerations do not apply under s 33(a)(iii).
    - Clarifies the AAT‚Äôs limited role in FOI reviews‚Äîit cannot override statutory exemptions based on public interest arguments.

      - ICAC made a finding of ‚Äúserious corrupt conduct‚Äù based on breach of the Ministerial Code of Conduct, including findings of conflict of interest, partial exercise of power and ‚Äúbreach of public trust‚Äù
    - Issue
      - Is the duty only a negative duty to avoid acting for improper reasons?

        - no

      - ‚Äú[A] matter of administration‚Äù means any subject that should arise in the course of administration, or putting it another way, in the performance of the executive function of government (at 558)
      - ‚Ä¢ ‚Äú[A]ny activity in the areas of the exercise of judicial function or the enactment of legislation by Parliament would be beyond the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman‚Äù (at 558)

      - The Director-General of Social Welfare (Booth) challenged jurisdiction
    - Issue
      - Did this complaint relate to a matter of administration?
        - yes

      - [T]he ... distinction to be drawn is that between acts which may properly be described as falling within the performance of the executive function of government and those which fall within the performance of the legislative and judicial functions of government (at 144)
      - The provisions to which I have referred, in my opinion, point strongly to the conclusion that... the governor is exercising his administrative responsibility for the due order, management and discipline of the prison under his charge. The hearing of charges ... is clearly related to the discharge of his administrative responsibility (at 147)
      - [E]ven if there are elements of what could be described as the discharge of a judicial function in what he does, such elements are incidents only to the executive function he is discharging (at 147)

      - [N]o clear line of demarcation exists between what is involved in policy and what is involved in administration (at 439)
      - The provision of funds for the particular purposes of a Department is not a matter of administration... The question of what should be included in the estimates of a Department, and the priority of those included, is again a matter of policy (at 439)
      - [I]t is a matter of administration as to whether or not any action of an administrative nature was or was not taken to deal with the matter of alleged sexual assaults (at 439).

  - TL;DR ‚Äî Week 2
    - Accountability: core administrative law theme, looks for adequate mechanisms to hold power in check and respond to accountability problems (eg lack of transparency, excess of power, abuse of power etc)
    - Parliament: supports executive accountability through principles of responsible government, representative government, and parliamentary committee scrutiny
    - Auditor-General: audits government finances and performance
    - Royal commissions: appointed by government to investigate a discrete issue of public concern (recommendations not binding)
    - Integrity commissions: ongoing scrutiny role in investigating government corruption and reducing opportunities for corruption
    - Ombudsmen: grievance-handling bodies that investigate maladministration and make recommendations (recommendations not binding)
    - Individual grievances v systemic issues: sometimes individual complaints (eg
      - ‚ÄúI should not have received this debt notice‚Äù) are symptoms of bigger underlying problems in executive power (eg the government is using an unlawful debt-notice system)
- "The Deep Colonizing Practices of the Australian Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody" ‚Äì Elena Marchetti
  - Title: 
    - The Deep Colonizing Practices of the Australian Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody
  - Author: 
    - Elena Marchetti
  - Published By: 
    - Journal of Law and Society (2006)
  - Context & Background:
    - The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC) was established in 1987 to investigate the deaths of 99 Indigenous people in custody between 1980‚Äì1989.
    - It was expected to be a transformative process addressing systemic racial injustice in the criminal justice system.
    - However, despite extensive findings and 339 recommendations, Indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody remain disproportionately high, and government responses have been inadequate.
    - This paper argues that RCIADIC, while intended to be a ‚Äúdecolonizing‚Äù inquiry, instead engaged in ‚Äúdeep colonizing‚Äù practices that reinforced colonial legal structures and marginalized Indigenous perspectives.
  - Key Issues Identified:
    - Liberal Legal Ideology as a Tool of Oppression
    - Law presents itself as neutral and objective, but in practice, it upholds colonial power structures.
    - Legal processes, rather than individual legal rules, continue to marginalize Indigenous peoples.
    - RCIADIC, despite being framed as an independent inquiry, relied on Western legal traditions that filtered and constrained Indigenous voices.
  - Structural Issues with RCIADIC‚Äôs Investigation
    - The inquiry‚Äôs methods, although appearing inclusive, failed to challenge existing institutional racism.
    - Despite the appointment of an Indigenous commissioner (Patrick Dodson) and the establishment of Aboriginal Issues Units (AIUs), Indigenous perspectives were often disregarded or reshaped to fit legalistic frameworks.
    - Legal professionals (mostly non-Indigenous) dominated the process, marginalizing Indigenous staff and community voices.
    - Failure to Incorporate Indigenous Knowledge and Cultural Sensitivities
    - Testimonies from Indigenous communities were undervalued if they did not meet Western evidentiary standards.
    - Gendered Indigenous experiences were silenced, particularly regarding women‚Äôs deaths, family violence, and systemic abuse.
    - Cultural protocols around discussing death were ignored, causing distress and alienation among Indigenous communities.
  - Denial of Justice and Lack of Tangible Outcomes
    - RCIADIC found that most deaths were not caused by deliberate police violence, but due to systemic over-incarceration and failures in custodial care.
    - No police or prison officers were held accountable, reinforcing Indigenous distrust in the legal system.
    - Many families of the deceased did not receive copies of death reports, highlighting a lack of transparency and respect.
    - Recommendations for reform were only partially implemented, and many have since been ignored.
    - Findings from Interviews (48 Participants, Both Indigenous & Non-Indigenous):
      - Social & Professional Subordination ‚Äì Indigenous staff, particularly those in AIUs, were paid less, given less authority, and worked in lower-status roles than their non-Indigenous counterparts.
      - Denial of Indigenous Expertise ‚Äì Indigenous perspectives were dismissed as unreliable, and AIUs had little control over how their research was used in the final report.
      - Cultural Blind Spots in Legal Processes ‚Äì The legal framework failed to accommodate Indigenous ways of knowing, grieving, and storytelling.
      - Emotional & Psychological Harm ‚Äì Indigenous staff and families experienced trauma, yet no support or counselling was provided during or after the inquiry.
  - Major Recommendations & Reforms (Implicit in the Paper):
    - Future inquiries should centre Indigenous knowledge, voices, and leadership rather than filtering them through Western legal structures.
    - Legal processes must acknowledge and integrate Indigenous cultural norms (e.g., protocols around discussing death and gendered perspectives).
    - Truth-telling mechanisms, rather than legal commissions, may be more appropriate for addressing historical injustices.
    - Structural reform is necessary beyond policy recommendations‚Äîthere must be binding obligations for government implementation.
  - Legal & Policy Impact:
    - RCIADIC remains one of Australia‚Äôs most significant legal inquiries, but its failure to implement real change demonstrates the limitations of state-led commissions in dismantling systemic racism.
    - Some Supreme Court justices (e.g., in South Australia) have referred to RCIADIC recommendations in sentencing Indigenous offenders, but systemic change has been minimal.
    - Indigenous incarceration rates have continued to rise, demonstrating that RCIADIC‚Äôs findings were not effectively acted upon.
    - The Uluru Statement from the Heart (2017) and calls for a Voice to Parliament can be seen as contemporary responses to the limitations of inquiries like RCIADIC.
  - Criticism & Debate:
    - Some scholars argue that RCIADIC‚Äôs failure was due to government inaction, not the commission itself.
    - Others, including Marchetti, argue that RCIADIC‚Äôs own processes reinforced colonial dominance, making meaningful reform impossible.
    - The paper contributes to critical legal scholarship by expanding the concept of "deep colonizing" and demonstrating how even well-intended legal inquiries can uphold systemic oppression.
  - Relevance to Modern Law:
    - Demonstrates the failure of legal institutions to fully decolonize and empower Indigenous communities.
    - Highlights the ongoing challenge of achieving justice for Indigenous deaths in custody.
    - Raises questions about whether legal commissions of inquiry are the best approach to Indigenous justice issues.
  - Final Takeaway: RCIADIC, despite its progressive aims, ultimately reinforced colonial legal structures, demonstrating the inherent limitations of state-led legal processes in addressing Indigenous injustice. Future reforms must move beyond symbolic inclusivity and ensure genuine Indigenous self-determination in legal and policy-making processes.

  - Beesley v Australian Federal Police (2001) 111 FCR 1
    - Facts
      - Applicant requested access to information held by the Australian Federal Police
      - The AFP had the ability to access a database (Law Enforcement Access Network ‚Äì LEAN) which was administered by the A-G‚Äôs Department
    - Issue
      - Was electronic information stored in LEAN a ‚Äòdocument‚Äô in the ‚Äòpossession‚Äô of the AFP?
    - Decision
      - [T]he question arises whether a document as defined in s 4 may qualify for the characterisation as one in the "possession" of an agency only if ‚Ä¶ the agency has actual physical possession of the document (at [64])
      - In my opinion, the concept of "constructive possession" in the sense explained by Jones J in Re Guide Dog Owners and Friends Association is apposite in the present context (at [72]):
        - ‚ÄúIn my view, having regard to the scheme and objects of the Act, possession embraces legal or constructive possession: that is a right and power to deal with the document in question. It is not confined to actual or physical possession.‚Äù
      - That question was simply not explored in any real sense by the Tribunal and for that reason alone, in my opinion, the matter must be remitted to the Tribunal (at [73])?
  - How?
    - Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth)
      - 15(2) The request must:
        - (a) be in writing; and

        - (b) provide such information concerning the document as is reasonably necessary to enable a responsible officer of the agency, or the Minister, to identify it; and
        - (c) give details of how notices under this Act may be sent to the applicant‚Ä¶
  - Warren v Chief Executive Officer, Services Australia [2024] FCAFC 73
    - Court:
      - Federal Court of Australia ‚Äì Full Court
    - Parties:
      - Appellant: Justin Warren
      - Respondent: Chief Executive Officer, Services Australia
    - Procedural History:
      - In January 2017, Mr. Warren made a Freedom of Information (FOI) request regarding the Pay As You Go (PAYG) data matching initiative, later known as Robodebt.
      - Services Australia denied access under FOI Act exemptions (ss 34 & 37(2)(b)).
      - The Information Commissioner (2019) set aside the decision for some documents but upheld it for others.
      - Services Australia appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), which found that certain documents were exempt under ss 34(1)(d), 34(3), and 47C of the FOI Act (Services Australia v Warren [2022] AATA 4191).
      - Mr. Warren appealed to the Federal Court under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), arguing the AAT erred in its legal interpretation and procedural handling of the case.
      - The Federal Court allowed the appeal, set aside the AAT‚Äôs decision, and remitted the matter for rehearing.
    - Facts:
      - Mr. Warren sought 10 documents related to New Policy Proposals (NPPs), draft NPPs, and costings prepared as part of the budgetary process and related to the Robodebt scheme.
      - Services Australia denied access under the Cabinet exemption (s 34(3) FOI Act), claiming disclosure would reveal Cabinet deliberations or decisions.
      - During the AAT proceedings, Services Australia changed its legal position multiple times regarding whether NPPs were submitted to Cabinet or merely proposed to be submitted.
      - Services Australia sought to reopen its case, relying on confidential evidence in a supplementary affidavit from Ms. McGregor, which was not disclosed to Mr. Warren due to confidentiality orders.
    - Legal Issues:
      - Procedural Fairness (Ground 1) ‚Äì Did the AAT err in permitting Services Australia to reopen its case based on confidential evidence, without giving Mr. Warren a fair opportunity to respond?
      - Reliance on Unchallenged Evidence (Ground 2) ‚Äì Did the AAT improperly rely on evidence from Scott Britton regarding the purpose of document creation, which Mr. Warren could not properly challenge?
      - Cabinet Exemption (Ground 3) ‚Äì Did the AAT misinterpret s 34(3) by concluding that a document containing information similar to a Cabinet document was itself exempt, even if it did not directly reveal Cabinet deliberations?
      - Official Disclosure Exception (Ground 4) ‚Äì Did the AAT misinterpret s 34(3) by requiring that the substance of a Cabinet deliberation be disclosed before the exemption no longer applied, instead of requiring only disclosure of the existence of a deliberation?
      - Public Interest Test (Ground 5) ‚Äì Did the AAT fail to properly consider the public interest in disclosure, particularly regarding documents 5 and 6, which had already been administratively released?
    - Decision:
      - The Federal Court allowed the appeal, set aside the AAT‚Äôs decision, and remitted the matter for rehearing.
      - The AAT denied Mr. Warren procedural fairness by allowing Services Australia to introduce confidential evidence that changed its case without giving Warren fair notice or opportunity to respond.
      - The AAT failed to evaluate submissions opposing the reopening of the case and did not provide reasons for its decision to do so.
      - The AAT erred in interpreting s 34(3) by misapplying the Cabinet exemption and narrowing the official disclosure exception beyond its statutory intent.
    - Ratio Decidendi:
      - Procedural fairness requires that parties be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to evidence, particularly where a party introduces new confidential evidence that materially alters its case.
      - A document is only exempt under s 34(3) if it directly reveals a Cabinet deliberation or decision. Mere similarity to a Cabinet document does not satisfy the exemption.
      - The "official disclosure" exception in s 34(3) applies when the existence of a Cabinet deliberation or decision has been disclosed‚Äîfull disclosure of the substance is not required.
      - When assessing public interest, the Tribunal must consider the FOI Act‚Äôs transparency objectives and balance confidentiality against the public benefit of disclosure.
    - Significance:
      - Clarifies the scope of the Cabinet exemption under the FOI Act, emphasizing a narrow interpretation to avoid excessive government secrecy.
      - Establishes that procedural fairness is paramount in FOI disputes, particularly when confidential evidence is relied upon.
      - Reaffirms that the FOI Act‚Äôs official disclosure exception does not require full disclosure of Cabinet deliberations, only acknowledgment of their existence.
      - Strengthens the principles of government transparency and accountability, particularly in high-profile cases related to public policy failures like Robodebt.

          - Yes
            - (3)(a) promote the objects of this Act ... ; -> See s 3!
            - (b) inform debate on a matter of public importance;
            - (c) promote effective oversight of public expenditure;
            - (d) allow a person to access his or her own personal information.
          - No
            - (4)(a) access ... could result in embarrassment to the Commonwealth Government, or cause a loss of confidence in the Commonwealth Government;
            - (b) access to the document could result in any person misinterpreting or misunderstanding the document;
            - (c) the author of the document was (or is) of high seniority in the agency to which the request for access to the document was made;
            - (d) access to the document could result in confusion or unnecessary debate
        - FOI Guidelines
          - 11B(5) In working out whether access to the document would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest, an agency or Minister must have regard to any guidelines issued by the Information Commissioner for the purposes of this subsection under section 93A.
          - Part 6
            - But recall status of Guidelines
          - Guidelines [6.224]:
            - Public interest versus individual interest (ie common concern for the public or a substantial section of the public)
            - In the interest versus of interest
            - Broad and applied to suit the particular case
          - Part 6.7
            - 1 Is the document conditionally exempt?

            - 5 Ignore irrelevant factors
            - 6 Weigh the relevant factors
        - The present s 11A(5) of the FOI Act expressly adopts a balancing test. But it does not do so on the basis that there is a starting point of ‚Äúempty scales in equilibrium‚Äù. By s 11B(3), certain factors telling in favour of the granting of access are already placed in the scales.

- Demonstration: interpreting an FOI exemption
  - Exemptions in FOI problem questions
    - Read the exemption provisions / Guidelines so you can spot relevant ones for your problem
    - Research your exemptions: this lecture is deliberately high level because the assessment focusses on research and statutory interpretation skills. Use the FOI Guidelines for help, and look at relevant cases on the exemptions you use.
    - Don‚Äôt stop work after identifying one basis for refusal. ie don‚Äôt find the single fastest path to ‚ÄúNo Access‚Äù in the decision tree, consider other possibilities too!
    - Consider alternative arguments. ie should you still discuss redaction if you‚Äôve argued an exemption does not apply?
    - IRAC analysis: Don‚Äôt just summarise the law and jump to a conclusion. Make sure you pull directly from the facts to show how the law applies to them
  - Statutory interpretation demo: interpreting and applying an exemption
    - 1. Identify key terms / phrases
        - Conditionally exempt: if this exemption applies, we will need to apply the public interest test to determine if it should be released
      - What is protected? -- ‚ÄúFinancial or property interests‚Äù
      - Whose interests? -- Commonwealth or agency
      - How likely does it need to be? -- ‚ÄúWould have‚Äù
      - How significant does the impact need to be? -- ‚ÄúSubstantial adverse effect‚Äù
    - 2. Internal FOI Act references
      - Defined terms?
        - Check the dictionary (s 4)
        - Search across the Act for definition provisions (eg ‚Äúoperational information‚Äù is defined in s 8A)
        - Some terms are defined in other Acts ‚Äì eg ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù is defined in s 4 to adopt its meaning from the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)
      - Context?
        - Follow up cross-references to other provisions (eg s 47H applies to ‚Äúagencies specified in Schedule 4‚Äù)
        - Consider the structure and context (eg ‚Äúwould have‚Äù in s 47D is presumably a higher standard than ‚Äúwould or could be expected‚Äù in other exemptions)
      - Purpose?
        - Prefer an interpretation that best achieves the legislative

- Distinguishing the merits
  - The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository‚Äôs power. If, in so doing, the court avoids administrative injustice or error, so be it; but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error. The merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone.

        - Courts
    - Blurred boundaries?
      - merits review bodies still interpret / apply the law
      - difficulty of separating questions of fact and law
      - some grounds of judicial review allow review of factual findings
      - States can have dual function tribunals (eg NSW Land and Environment Court)
  - Example
    - Fisheries Licencing Act 2018 (Cth)
      - 12. The Director of Fisheries may cancel a fishing licence if the holder of the licence is not of good character.
      - 13. If proposing to exercise the power conferred under s 12, the Director of Fisheries must first afford the licence-holder an opportunity to make submissions.
    - Ken receives a speeding fine after being caught by a speed camera driving at 87km/h in an 80 zone.
      - Two weeks later, Ken receives a notice from the Director of Fisheries cancelling his fishing licence. The Director indicates the cancellation is based on his lack of good character, as evidenced by his poor driving record
        - Notice: Decision 
        - Director of Fisheries: Original Decision-maker
    - Merits review
      - Is Ken of good character?
      - Do I think a person is not of good character based on a speeding fine?
      - Should I cancel Ken‚Äôs fishing licence?

  - New South Wales Thoroughbred Racing Board v Waterhouse (2003) 56 NSWLR 691
    - Facts
      - Robbie Waterhouse gave a friend very inflated odds on a race to help him win enough money to pay off business debts
      - Original decision-maker gave Waterhouse a 9-month suspension
      - Waterhouse appealed to the Racing Appeals Tribunal, who increased the penalty to a 9-month disqualification
      - The matter was ultimately appealed to the NSW Court of Appeal
    - Issue
      - Did the Tribunal have the power to consider the matter afresh, or to consider the correctness of the original decision?
        - Yes
    - Decision
      - In this case, I accept that the Tribunal did not approach its task as one where detection of error was required before the decision of the Panel could be interfered with. On the appeal against sentence, the Tribunal took the view that it could substitute its own view without first deciding that there was error. That was in my opinion an error ... (at 718, [106] per Hodgson JA)
  - ‚ÄòCorrect and preferable‚Äô

    - Judicial review
      - Adversarial approach
      - Formal
      - Outcome ‚Äì invalidate and refer back to original decision-maker 
  - Rationale for merits review
    - The basic fault of the entire structure is, however, that review cannot as a general rule ... be obtained "on the merits"‚Äîand this is usually what the aggrieved citizen is seeking.

  - TL;DR ‚Äî Week 3B
    - Separation of powers: Power is distributed to prevent tyranny ‚Äì each branch should stay in its own lane (separation principle), and should be subject to checks and balances (supervision principle)
    - The ‚Äúmerits‚Äù: The merits of a decision reflects the exercise of decision-making freedom or discretion, eg ‚ÄúI think this is the best way to exercise this power‚Äù 
    - Legality: The executive must stay within legal boundaries on its powers when deciding the merits
    - Merits review: A merits reviewer revisits the merits of a decision, forming their own view on the correct (ie legal) and preferable (ie most preferred of the legal options) outcome
    - Who can decide/review the merits? The executive has final say on the merits ‚Äì courts trespassing into the merits is a potential SOP concern (cf State level)
    - Who can decide/review legality? The courts have a final say on interpreting the law (ie the legality of a decision) ‚Äì while merits reviewers do fix legal errors (ie make the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù decision), they do not have a final say on the meaning of the law
